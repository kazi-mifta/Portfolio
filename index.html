                                <p>I am a 3D Software Engineer at <a href="https://structure.io/">Structure(XRPro, LLC)</a> in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boulder,_Colorado">Boulder, Colorado. </a>My core responsibility here is to research and develop analytic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropometry">anthropometry </a> methods. I am using 3D reconstructed meshes from patient scans to develop these methods. I am also involved in developing techniques to grade mesh quality. I have conducted an extensive research on human foot mesh anthropometry. Currently, my focus has shifted towards facial scans, with a specific emphasis on the precise localization of key landmarks of the 3D facial meshes.

                                <p> Arch height difference is measured using scans of load-bearing and non-load-bearing foot. It is an indicator of pronation of the foot. It also helps to determine the mobility and flexibility of the foot's arch. This is valuable in several contexts, including sports medicine, physical therapy, and biomechanical assessments.</p>

Also devised algorithms for accurately measuring the foot's width, length, and ball girth. These algorithms have been seamlessly integrated and deployed within a cloud-based infrastructure. Thorough testing was carried out with a dataset consisting of 1 million foot scans. The results were impressive, as the system performed well even on foot scans with challenging issues like noises, holes, etc.</p>

                                At Structure, I thoroughly analyzed a massive dataset of 1 million foot scans, resulting in the development of innovative algorithms for accurately measuring human foot dimensions. Additionally, I created techniques to grade the quality of foot scans by examining the dataset. As part of my work, I also developed an iOS application that demonstrated impressive 3D reconstruction capabilities using Apple's TrueDepth sensor technology. This application was showcased at the American Orthotics and Prosthetics Association meeting held in September 2022 in San Antonio, Texas.

Additionally, I integrated these research findings into an iOS app used by Pedorthists to improve patient treatment.
